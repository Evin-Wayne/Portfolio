The main project of my group in software engineering 1. A webapp/ website that functions as an employee clock-in / clock-out and management system. the employee can clock-in and out as well as request time off and view their upcoming schedule, the manager can make and edit shifts. The main goal of this project was learing the process of proper documentation and development in the workplace, and implementing that in our own project.

Another website I did for a project with the same classmate as vampfind. the main goal here was to learn and implement a database that could be changed by the website. The website is for keeping track of a videogame collection and keeping notes on individual entries. The website allows you to add or edit entries and change how they are sorted.

A little website me and a classmate did as a class assignment. You input the answers to a short survey and the website tells you if the person is a vampire.
